    <h3>Description</h3>
<p>This unique lasagna is filled with artichokes and spinach and topped with crumbled herb and<br>
from the hot sauce. "I made this for an ultra-picky friend once, and need to make it again soon.<br>
 It's a GREAT variation on the typical meat lasagna. My only change     garlic feta cheese. Reviewers say you don't need to boil your lasagna noodles <br>
 before cooking, instead, you can use no-boil noodles or dry noodles that will soften s were <br>
 use a homemade sauce, and I never boil my noodles first," says home cook Zanne.</p>
